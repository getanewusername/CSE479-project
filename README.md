Project Description:
                   The act of predicting future weather conditions or an attempt to 
suggest the weather conditions that are likely to occur is known as weather forecasting. 
Nowadays, accurate depiction of weather is in great demand. Meteorologists use different 
computer programs for modeling weather forecasts in different places of the Earth. Numerical 
weather prediction, which can be defined as "a system of simplified equations used to 
calculate changes in atmospheric conditions," is mostly employed in current forecasting models. 
In our project, we have decided to create a very oversimplified model for weather prediction 
using Python Flask. Flask is a web application framework written in python. Web application 
developers can design apps without having to be concerned about low-level aspects like protocol, 
thread management, and other issues thanks to a web framework, also known as a web application 
framework. In our project, we will be giving different dataset and implement various different 
functions in the main.py segment, as well as HTML file as a flask template, and create a custom 
web server and a web page to show our weather forecasting model.
